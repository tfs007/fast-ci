That’s awesome — as a **trainer**, demonstrating **automated authenticated ZAP scans on SSO-based apps** can be a real eye-opener for your audience. Here's how to make it **realistic, practical, and safe** while staying within your training environment constraints.

---

## ✅ Goal:
Simulate a real-world SSO environment and show how ZAP can scan a web app **after authentication**, even when SSO is involved.

---

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Training Plan

### 🔹 **1. Use a Demo App with Simple SSO Simulation**
Instead of using a full SAML or OAuth2 flow, use a **mock SSO** setup that:
- Redirects to a login page
- Sets a session cookie after login

➡️ For example:  
Use [**OWASP Juice Shop**](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop) (has login with JWT), or build a **FastAPI app** with a login route that sets a cookie.

You can say:
> “This simulates a simplified version of an SSO workflow – user logs in, gets authenticated via a session or JWT cookie.”

---

### 🔹 **2. Show Manual Login with Selenium**
- Walk through a simple **Python+Selenium** script to log in
- Show how to extract cookies after login
- Save those cookies in a JSON file

➡️ **Live demo this part!** Your learners will see the browser auto-login — always a crowd-pleaser.

---

### 🔹 **3. Show How to Import Cookies into ZAP**
Use ZAP’s Python API or GUI to:
- Import the cookies into an HTTP session
- Make one authenticated request through ZAP (priming the session)
- Start spider and active scan

> “Now ZAP thinks it’s logged in and can explore internal pages protected by SSO.”

---

### 🔹 **4. Use the ZAP HUD (Heads-Up Display)**
If you're live-sharing your screen:
- Use the ZAP HUD in a browser
- Show login in one tab
- Watch ZAP capture requests in real time

Great for visual learners 👀

---

### 🔹 **5. Bonus: Automation with GitHub Actions + ngrok**
If you’re training developers or DevSecOps:
- Set up GitHub Actions to run ZAP scans
- Use `ngrok` to expose a local app
- Show them how ZAP in GitHub Actions can scan the app over ngrok with cookies or tokens

---

## 🧠 Talking Points During the Training
- Why ZAP can’t directly handle SAML or OAuth redirects
- How automation scripts bridge that gap
- How CI pipelines can be integrated with authenticated scans
- Risks of scanning prod vs. test/staging
- Importance of test accounts and controlled environments

---

## 🎓 Training Materials You Can Prepare
- ✅ A FastAPI app with `/login` and `/private`
- ✅ Selenium login script (already written)
- ✅ ZAP cookie import snippet
- ✅ Sample GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ Slides explaining each part visually

Would you like me to package these materials (FastAPI app, Selenium script, ZAP script, GitHub workflow) into a trainer-friendly zip for your session?
